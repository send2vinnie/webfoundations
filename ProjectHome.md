# WebFoundations #
_A simple, SEO Friendly, C#, ASP.NET, XML Content Management System (CMS)_

These 'WebFoundations' are a great starting block when developing an ASP.NET CMS.

Features:
  * A WYSIWYG editor (FCKEditor)
  * Content caching (No IO overhead)
  * Multi language support (can be set on querystring or dropdown)
  * Search engine friendly URL's (url rewriting)
  * Easily themable (Build on ASP.Net Master Pages)
  * An image gallery control (it consumes XML Picasa exports)

Web Foundation sites can be hosted on _inexpensive hosting_ as there is **NO Database requirement** (all the data is stored in XML files).

These days if I want a simple website, with basic CMS features, that I can host for next to nothing I use Static-CMS: http://cprobert.github.io/Static-CMS/
