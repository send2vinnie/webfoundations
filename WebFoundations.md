# WebFoundations #

WebFoundations are a great starting block when developing a C# ASP.NET CMS.

# Features #

  * A WYSIWYG editor (FCKEditor)
  * Content caching (No IO overhead)
  * Multi language support (can be set on querystring or dropdown)
  * Search engine friendly URL's (url rewriting)
  * Easily themable (Build on ASP.Net Master Pages)
  * An image gallery control (it consumes XML Picasa exports)

Web Foundation sites can be hosted on inexpensive hosting as there is NO Database requirement (all the data is stored in XML files).
